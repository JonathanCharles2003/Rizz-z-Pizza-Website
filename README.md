# Rizz-z-Pizza-Website
This mini project was done to test the limits of using only html and very minimal css
This is a website that contains 3 pages:

1)index page
2)contact page
3)Working hours page

Css is used only to draw the tables and for the 2 primary verticle lines that make the website look somewhat decent as opposed to completely not using css 

Some of the concepts applied here are:
1)Text Basics
2)List types
3)Adding links 
4)Adding Images
5)Semantic tags
6)Creating tables
7)Forms and Inputs from user 

Conclusion:
CSS is mandatory to make the websites look much better
